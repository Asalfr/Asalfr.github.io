  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

    abstract = "{The beneficial effect of elevated concentrations of copper (Cu) on growth performance of pigs has been already demonstrated; however, their mechanism of action is not fully discovered. The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the effects of including Cu from copper sulfate (CuSO4) or monovalent copper oxide (Cu2O) in the diet of growing pigs on oxidative stress, inflammation, gene abundance, and microbial modulation. We used 120 pigs with initial body weight (BW) of 11.5 ± 0.98 kg in 2 blocks of 60 pigs, 3 dietary treatments, 5 pigs per pen, and 4 replicate pens per treatment within each block for a total of 8 pens per treatment. Dietary treatments included the negative control (NC) diet containing 20 mg Cu/kg and 2 diets in which 250 mg Cu/kg from CuSO4 or Cu2O was added to the NC. On day 28, serum samples were collected from one pig per pen and this pig was then euthanized to obtain liver samples for the analysis of oxidative stress markers (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde, MDA). Serum samples were analyzed for cytokines. Jejunum tissue and colon content were collected and used for transcriptomic analyses and microbial characterization, respectively. Results indicated that there were greater (P \\&lt; 0.05) MDA levels in the liver of pigs fed the diet with 250 mg/kg CuSO4 than in pigs fed the other diets. The serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was greater (P \\&lt; 0.05) in pigs fed diets containing CuSO4 compared with pigs fed the NC diet or the diet with 250 mg Cu/kg from Cu2O. Pigs fed diets containing CuSO4 or Cu2O had a greater (P \\&lt; 0.05) abundance of genes related to the intestinal barrier function and nutrient transport, but a lower (P \\&lt; 0.05) abundance of pro-inflammatory genes compared with pigs fed the NC diet. Supplementing diets with CuSO4 or Cu2O also increased (P \\&lt; 0.05) the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Peptostreptococcaceae families and reduced (P \\&lt; 0.05) the abundance of the Rikenellaceae family, Campylobacter, and Streptococcus genera in the colon of pigs. In conclusion, adding 250 mg/kg of Cu from CuSO4 or Cu2O regulates genes abundance in charge of the immune system and growth, and promotes changes in the intestinal microbiota; however, Cu2O induces less systemic oxidation and inflammation compared with CuSO4.Copper is a nonrenewable mineral resource that is essential for all biological organisms. After banning the antibiotics, copper has received considerable attention due to its antimicrobial properties that improve performance in animals when fed over the minimum requirement. The present study evaluated two sources of Cu (copper sulfate and monovalent copper oxide) compared with a nonsupplemented diet and the likely mechanism of action which leads to improved pig performance. Pigs fed high concentrations of copper sulfate showed increased liver oxidation and inflammatory indicators in the blood. Elevated concentrations of Cu improved intestinal epithelial barrier function, modulation of inflammatory responses, increased beneficial microbes, and reduced pathogens in the gut. Therefore, supplementation of high levels of Cu appears to be effective in promoting pig growth, but therapeutic doses of Cu sulfate increase the inflammatory response.}",
