In 2016, I embarked on my academic adventure in Toulouse, France, where I pursued a double degree MSc in European Animal Management at [Ecole d'Ingénieurs de PURPAN](https://www.purpan.fr/). Following that, I continued my journey in Debrecen, Hungary, immersing myself in the realm of Sustainable Animal Nutrition and Feeding at the [University of Debrecen](https://www.edu.unideb.hu/). 

I recently completed my PhD in Animal Production at the [SNiBA](https://sniba.es/?lang=en) group of [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html). My research primarily revolved around pigs and poultry. Guided by the expertise of [José Francisco Pérez](https://sniba.es/conocenos/quienes-somos/jose-francisco-perez/) and [David Solà Oriol](https://sniba.es/conocenos/quienes-somos/david-sola-oriol/), I delved into the fascinating world of trace minerals, specifically copper (Cu), as feed additives. Beyond just boosting animal production, I also explored their broader impact on the environment.
